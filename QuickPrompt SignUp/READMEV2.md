# ⚙️ QuickPrompt SignUp — Architecture Comparison

</br>

## 📋 Overview

This document compares two architectural approaches to the main registration flow in the **QuickPrompt SignUp** project. The goal is to showcase the strengths and trade-offs of each version while providing clean, maintainable code examples.

In addition to the README, this project uses **[JSDoc](./docs/monolithic/index.html)** to generate full API documentation for the monolithic version.

## 🧱 Version 1 — Modular, Function-Based [`main_function.js`](https://github.com/apedrodev1/JavaScript-Learning-HUB/blob/main/QuickPrompt%20SignUp/js/functions/mainFunction.js)

### ✅ Pros
- Highly modular — each responsibility lives in its own function/module.
- Easier to maintain, test, and refactor.
- Cleaner `main_function` focused on flow orchestration.
- Encourages reusability and separation of concerns.

### ❌ Cons
- Slightly more complex structure.
- Requires understanding of imports and modular design.
- More files to manage — possibly overkill for small-scale scripts.

## 🧩 Version 2 — Monolithic (Refactored) [`main_functionV2.js`](https://github.com/apedrodev1/JavaScript-Learning-HUB/blob/main/QuickPrompt%20SignUp/js/functions/mainFunctionV2.js)

### ✅ Pros
- Simple and straightforward — logic is centralized.
- Easier for beginners or quick prototype development.
- Fewer files, easier initial setup.

### ❌ Cons
- Harder to maintain as logic grows.
- Difficult to test functions in isolation.
- Repetitive code and limited separation of concerns.

## 🆚 Summary
</br>

| Aspect            | Version 1 (Modular)                  | Version 2 (Monolithic)            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Code organization | Multiple reusable functions/modules  | Single procedural function        |
| Readability       | High — clear and logical flow        | Lower — cluttered as it grows     |
| Maintainability   | Easier to extend or debug            | Harder over time                  |
| Testing           | Functions can be tested in isolation | Requires full execution           |
| Learning curve    | Slightly steeper (modular JS)        | Very accessible                   |
| Scalability       | High — good for long-term projects   | Limited to small apps/scripts     |
